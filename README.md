# Reference Monitor

The `repy/` directory contains a complete RepyV2 build, along with two files
I wrote (based on skeleton code):  
`reference_monitor_th2313.r2py`  
`attack_th2313.r2py`

### Usage:  
`cd repy`
`python2 repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py reference_model_th2313.r2py attack_th2313.r2py`
